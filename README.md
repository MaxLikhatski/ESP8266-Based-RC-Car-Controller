# ESP8266-Based-RC-Car-Controller
The project is intended to built a system to control a four-wheel (driven with 4 DC motor) moving platform using, along with car itself, ESP8266-based NodeM RobotDyn development board, some Arduino code and a few html-pages, comprising web-interface to control the RC-car. Both the photo of the car and those of double H-bridge driver based on LM293N integrated circuit can be found in the root folder of the repository. EnA and EnB inputs of the driver board are used to adjust the speed of the car; this feature is achieved using PWM regulation, while direction of the car is controlled by setting appropriate logic levels on In1-4 inputs.  The project exists in two implementations, with the master branch corresponding to version for browsers installed on desktop PCs, while 'version-For-Mobile-Browsers' branch is getting ready to operate in browsers installed on mobile devices. The differences between them consist in types of events, which web-interface should handle with during user interaction, with a transformation of 'onmousedown' envent into 'ontouchstart', and 'onmouseup' - 'ontouchend' (and vice versa) taking place.
So, if you want to control your car with web-interface running on a desktop or a laptop PC, you are recommended to fetch version of the project from the 'master' branch, otherwise you have to get 'version-For-Mobile-Browsers'.
