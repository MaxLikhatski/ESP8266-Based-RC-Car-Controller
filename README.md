# ESP8266-Based-RC-Car-Controller
The project intends to built a system to control a four-wheel (driven with 4 DC motor) moving platform using, along with car itself, ESP8266-based NodeM RobotDyn development board, some Arduino code and a few html-pages, comprising web-interface to control the RC-car. The project exists in two implementations, with the master branch corresponding to version for browsers installed on desktop PCs, while 'version-For-Mobile-Browsers' branch is getting ready to operate in browsers installed on mobile devices. The differences between these two versions are the types of events, which web-interface should handle with during user interaction, with a transformation of 'onmousedown' envent into 'ontouchstart', and 'onmouseup' - 'ontouchend' (and vice versa) taking place.
So, if you want to control your car with desktop or laptop PC, you are recommended to fetch version of the project from the 'master' branch, otherwise I recommend you to get 'version-For-Mobile-Browsers'.
